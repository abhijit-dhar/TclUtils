# TclUtils
This repository contains Tcl scripts which could be used as basic building block for resolving customer issues. Please note that these scripts will work only if IxNetwork and its low-level tcl library exists in your system. In other words, following commands must work from your Tcl console witout any error.

`% package require IxTclNetwork`

`% package require Ixia`
