# Packet parse problem

Saved capture files that are in .pcap format cannot be parsed by IxAnalyzer APIs. 
This script shows how we can parse saved capture files using tshark utility. 
If you are using IxNetwork wireshark will be installed as axulary software along with it.
This script assumes tshark utility is spawnable from TCL shell.
